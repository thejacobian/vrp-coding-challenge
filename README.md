# vrp-coding-challenge

Runs via cmd line "node index.js" and will accept input file from dir ./trainingProblems/ with python evaluator script; then prints desired route formats to the command line. It does not currently take into account dropoff points only pickup points, but there is some experimentation with an external mapbox node-or-tools package that supposedly does support pickups and deliveries arrays.
